    "Traffic accidents represent one of the leading causes of death worldwide and of economic expenditure. Despite the numerous measures and campaigns that are deployed every year to raise awareness of the seriousness of the problem, it still occurs quite frequently. The impact of road accidents on society and the economy is high, and human losses are compounded by large expenditures on health care, awareness campaigns, mobilization of specialized personnel, etc. The WHO sets the economic impact of road accidents in a developed country at 2 to 3% of GDP, a significant figure for any country. Collaboration to reduce these losses has become an important issue of general interest.\n",
